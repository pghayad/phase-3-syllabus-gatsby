# Factory Functions

So far, we've been working with objects by just declaring them using an object literal. But that means every time we create a new object with the same functionality, we'd need re-write the same code over and over.

We're going to work towards using the `class` syntax in Javascript, but first, we'll talk about some OOJS history, how OOJS patterns evolved, and Javascript's Prototypal Inheritance system.

Let's imagine we have an application that needs to construct robot objects in JavaScript. Each robot should have a `name`, `weight`, and `specialty`. We could create several using the object literal syntax:

```javascript
const robot1 = { name: 'sparko', weight: 1000, specialty: 'making sparks' }
const robot2 = { name: 'the iron giant', weight: 9999999, specialty: 'being giant and made of iron' }
const robot3 = { name: 'bender', weight: 500, specialty: 'bending things' }
```

While this approach works, it's extremely tedious **and error prone!!** This leaves us open to typos and other mistakes! We could instead choose to write a function that constructs objects for us (these are called [factory functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming))):

```javascript
// Bronze Age OOJS (Factory Functions)
function robotFactory(name, weight, specialty) {
  return {
    name: name,
    weight: weight,
    specialty: specialty
  }
}

const robot1 = robotFactory('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = robotFactory('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = robotFactory('bender', 500, 'bending things')
```

> Quick note about the snippet above: in modern JavaScript, ES6 and later, we can create objects using a shorter syntax. If a key/value pair share the same name, we can abbreviate our statement like so: `{ name: name }` becomes `{ name }`. Both will create an object with a key of name pointing to whatever value is stored in the variable called `name`.

Let's add some functionality to our robots by adding a method to our objects:

```javascript
function robotFactory(name, weight, specialty) {
  return {
    name,
    weight,
    specialty,
    rechargeBatteries: function() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is recharging its batteries`)
    }
  }
}

const robot1 = robotFactory('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = robotFactory('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = robotFactory('bender', 500, 'bending things')

robot1.rechargeBatteries() //'sparko is recharging its batteries'
```

Recall that a function (declared with the `function` keyword) will resolve `this` based on its **execution context**. If `rechargeBatteries` is called **on** robot1, `robot1.rechargeBatteries`, `this` will be `robot1`.

Again, this is _getting better_ but there's still a flaw in our approach:

```javascript
robot1.rechargeBatteries === robot2.rechargeBatteries // false
```

`robot1.rechargeBatteries` is a different function, occupying a different place in memory than `robot2.rechargeBatteries`. **We are wasting memory by constantly redeclaring `rechargeBatteries` every time we create a new robot**. This is _bad_. We don't want to be wasteful.

```javascript

function rechargeBatteriesFn() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is recharging its batteries`)
}

function robotFactory(name, weight, specialty) {
  return {
    name,
    weight,
    specialty,
    rechargeBatteries: rechargeBatteriesFn
  }
}


const robot1 = robotFactory('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = robotFactory('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')

robot1.recharge === robot2.recharge // true

robot1.recharge() //'sparko is recharging its batteries'
```

Better! But it would be nice if we could make it more readily apparent that the `rechargeBatteries` function was only meant to be used with a `robot` object.

In Ruby this problem was easily solved by using class based inheritance:

```ruby
class Robot
  attr_reader :name, :weight, :specialty

  def initialize(name, weight, specialty)
    @name = name
    @weight = weight
    @specialty = specialty
  end

  def recharge_batteries
    puts "#{self.name} is recharging its batteries"
  end

end

robot1 = Robot.new('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
robot1.recharge_batteries #=> sparko is recharging its batteries
```

JavaScript however, **does not have classes**. Ruby has these special things called _classes_ that allow us to create blueprints for our instances. JavaScript relies on prototypal inheritance. In essence, almost everything in JavaScript is an object: functions, object literals, even arrays. JavaScript objects have a chain of prototypes; other objects that define certain _shared functionality_. If a method is not defined on a particular object, JavaScript will look _up the chain of prototypes_ (which are plain old JavaScript objects) until it either finds the method or errors out.

> "When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this prototype chain.
> Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object which sits on the top of a prototype chain." - [MDN Article on Inheritance and the Prototype Chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain)

## Prototypal Inheritance

So we need to find a place where we can store methods that are related to specific objects in our application, so it's clear where that functionality belongs.

Let's look at another kind of object for an example and see where that object gets its behavior, then we can try to apply the same approach to our objects.

Take an array for an example. How does an array know about the `.forEach` method? Or `.map`?

```js
const numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers.map(num => num * 2)
```

It's not on the array directly (check it out in the console) - but if we look at a special `__proto__` property we'll get a hint.

```js
numbers.__proto__.map === numbers.map // true
```

We can also see the array's constructor: Array; that gives us a hint. If we do `new Array()` we can see another way of creating new Array objects that gives us a hint on how this relates back to the `new` keyword and constructor we saw in earlier lessons.

```js
numbers.constructor // Array
```

So there's a link between the object ("instance") and its constructor function ("class"), and that link is the prototype!

```js
Array.prototype === numbers.__proto__
Array.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log("hey I'm an array")
}
```

> JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language — to provide inheritance, objects can have a prototype object, which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from. An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on. This is often referred to as a prototype chain, and explains why different objects have properties and methods defined on other objects available to them."

> To be exact, the properties and methods are defined on the prototype property on the Objects' constructor functions, not the object instances themselves.

> In JavaScript, a link is made between the object instance and its prototype (its `__proto__` property, which is derived from the prototype property on the constructor), and the properties and methods are found by walking up the chain of prototypes." - [MDN Article on Object Prototypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

Let's update our `robotFactory` so that it is a [constructor function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor). A constructor function is a JavaScript function that creates object "instances."

```js
function Robot(name, weight, specialty) {
  // `this` in the context of a constructor function will be the newly created object {}
  this.name = name
  this.weight = weight
  this.specialty = specialty
}

// any function can be called as a constructor with the `new` operator (see notes below for more info on the `new` operator)
const robot1 = new Robot('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = new Robot('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = new Robot('bender', 500, 'bending things')
```

A few notes on the `new` operator:

>  When the code `new Foo(...)` is executed, the following things happen:
>
  > 1.  A new object is created, inheriting from `Foo.prototype`.
>
  > 2. The constructor function `Foo` is called with the specified arguments, and with `this` bound to the newly created object. `new Foo` is equivalent to `new Foo()`, i.e. if no argument list is specified, Foo is called without arguments.
>
  > 3. The object returned by the constructor function becomes the result of the whole `new` expression. If the constructor function doesn't explicitly return an object, the object created in step 1 is used instead. (Normally constructors don't return a value, but they can choose to do so if they want to override the normal object creation process.)
>
> You can add a shared property to a previously defined object type by using the `Function.prototype` property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects created with that function, rather than by just one instance of the object type. - [MDN `new` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new)


As it relates to our example, when a function is called with the `new` operator––`new Robot('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')`––`this` will point to the **newly created object**. Writing this constructor function also _adds_ an object that points to `Robot` in the newly created object's ("instance") prototype chain:

```javascript
Robot.prototype
// the prototype is an object with a KEY of constructor that points to our Robot function:
// {
  // constructor: ƒ Robot(name, weight, specialty)
// }
```

This object is in turn added as the `__proto__` for all robots created from our constructor:

```js
const r = new Robot('rob', 3, 'JavaScript')
r.__proto__ === Robot.prototype // true
```

> A note on [`__proto__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto): this is a feature available in most browsers for convenience, but it's not recommended that you use this code outside of the console. The object's prototype is stored as an internal reference (something the browser engine can access via `[[Prototype]]`), but not meant for developers to change/interact with directly! You can use `Object.getPrototypeOf(yourObject)` instead if you want to see the `__proto__` property.

Let's leverage our new understanding of the prototype chain to avoid duplicating `rechargeBatteries`:

```js
function Robot(name, weight, specialty) {
  this.name = name
  this.weight = weight
  this.specialty = specialty
}

Robot.prototype.rechargeBatteries = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is recharging its batteries`)
}

const robot1 = new Robot('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = new Robot('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = new Robot('bender', 500, 'bending things')

robot1.rechargeBatteries() //'sparko is recharging its batteries'
robot2.rechargeBatteries() //'the iron giant is recharging its batteries'
robot3.rechargeBatteries() //'bender is recharging its batteries'
```

- We're no longer duplicating `rechargeBatteries`:

```javascript
robot1.rechargeBatteries === robot2.rechargeBatteries // true
```

- Also note that we're adding methods to `Robot.prototype`, not directly to `RobotFactory` itself. Recall:

```js
Robot.prototype
{
  rechargeBatteries: ƒ (),
  constructor: ƒ Robot(name, weight, specialty)
}
```

`Robot`'s prototype is ANOTHER OBJECT with a key of `constructor` that points to the `Robot` function itself and another key that points to `rechargeBatteries`. Any objects created from Robot can look up this chain of ancestors to find the `rechargeBatteries` method.

We can also explore this concept of prototypal inheritance more here by looking at some build-in objects:

```js
const arr = [1,2,3]
console.dir(arr)
// __proto__ is where .forEach lives

// Monkey patching
Array.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log("hi im an array")
}

// Method lookup
dog1.toString() // where does this come from?
```

## "Classes" in JavaScript

> "JavaScript classes, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, are primarily syntactical sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance. **The class syntax does not introduce a new object-oriented inheritance model to JavaScript.**" - [MDN Article on the `class` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

Although we can use the `class` keyword in modern JavaScript, the language **does not support true object orientation**. JS still relies on a prototypal inheritance model and "classes" are in fact **_functions_** (which are technically objects). Let's see an example of the `class` keyword in use:

```javascript
class Robot {
  constructor(name, weight, specialty) {
    this.name = name
    this.weight = weight
    this.specialty = specialty
  }

  rechargeBatteries() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is recharging its batteries`)
  }
}

const robot1 = new Robot('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = new Robot('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = new Robot('bender', 500, 'bending things')

robot1.rechargeBatteries() //'sparko is recharging its batteries'
robot2.rechargeBatteries() //'the iron giant is recharging its batteries'
robot3.rechargeBatteries() //'bender is recharging its batteries'
```

Some notes on the snippet above:

> "The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a `class`. There can only be one special method with the name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a `constructor` method." - [MDN Article on `class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)

When using the `new` operator on a `class`, JavaScript will look for and invoke this special `constructor` function. You can think of this as being _similar_ to Ruby's `initialize` method. It is, however, not the same because JavaScript is not actually object oriented. The `class` syntax is just syntactic sugar over our previous example that manually added methods to the objects in our robot's prototype chain.

## Private Methods/Variables

- In Ruby, making something `private` is as easy as this:

```ruby
class Donut
  attr_reader :flavor
  def initialize(flavor)
    @flavor = flavor
  end

  private

  def super_private
    puts "wow, so secret!"
  end
end
```

One upcoming feature of the Javascript language is the ability to create private variables (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) using `class fields` - at time of writing, this feature is a Stage 3 proposal and has limited browser support.

To create a private class field, it must be declared in the class body (outside of any method declarations) using a `#` as a prefix (ie `#id`).

Let's imagine that we need to keep track of the total number of robots produced by our factory and assign an auto-incrementing id to each one. We can use a private class field to keep track of each robot's id, a `getter` method to expose the id outside the class, and a `setter` method to throw an error if someone tries to set this property outside the class.

```javascript
class Robot {
  // static class fields are like class variables in Ruby
  static #autoIncrement = 1

  // this is a private class field, when our new Robot is created it will be assigned to the current ID from the Robot static class field
  #id = Robot.#autoIncrement

  constructor(name, weight, specialty) {
    this.name = name
    this.weight = weight
    this.specialty = specialty
    Robot.#autoIncrement++ // update the class field
  }

  get id() {
    return this.#id
  }

  set id(value) {
    throw new Error("ID is private!")
  }

  rechargeBatteries() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is recharging its batteries`)
  }
}
```

- We can now encapsulate some private variables within our class:

```javascript
const robot1 = new Robot('sparko', 1000, 'making sparks')
const robot2 = new Robot('the iron giant', 9999999, 'being giant and made of iron')
const robot3 = new Robot('bender', 500, 'bending things')

console.log(robot1.id) //1
console.log(robot2.id) //2
console.log(robot3.id) //3

robot1.id = "one" // Uncaught Error: ID is private!
```
